/**
 * @describe These tests validate the functionality of {Hackathon.sol} by using
 * a Mock inherited contract ({HackathonMock})
 * @dev Tests coverage:
 * - Access controls and other integrity checks (modifiers): checks if contract reverts
 * when appropriate, as well as allows usage when sender has the right permission.
 * - Core functionality: checks the intended contract's core functionality, making sure it
 * performs what is expected (PS: due to the complexity in some scenarios, where the next test
 * depends on previous steps, and to keep each test independent, some tests duplicate codes to
 * execute the required steps needed to validate the expected functionality).
 * - Events: checks if contracts triggers the expected events
